# Mini-Robotic-Arm
This was a very quick project that I did for an event, to show how robotics works. At the UCMAS 2025 Math Competition in Quebec, somewhere in Montreal or Laval. I ran a Robotics booth for the OBotz Canada program, which is a program for kids to teens to learn about robotics and electrical engineering. I built this small robotic arm using 3D-printed base and arms. I used 3 servo motors to control the shoulder, elbow and claw of the arm. I used a stepper motor to allow the arm to roll in the z-axis. Then, after wiring everything up, i made a simple code where moving the joystick allows the robotic arm to go back and fourth and open and close the claw. I used on-board tact switches to rotate the arm using the stepper motor.
